# pythonlifescience

This is a simple Python script created for a class I attended on Python programming. It takes raw Ethovision shoal data, from shoals consisting of four fish, and exports shoal dynamics variables: nearest neighbor distance, farthest neighbor distance, interfish distance, and shoal index. All variables are described in Maaswinkel et al 2013: "Assessing Social Engagement in Heterogeneous Groups of Zebrafish: A New Paradigm for Autism-Like Behavioral Responses".

A note on shoal size: All variables except shoal index are not sensitive to the number of fish, so any shoal size could work.

Intructions:

1) Download script file.
2) Place script file in directory with raw data from Ethovision.
3) Double-click and wait.

Results are created in a xlsx file in the same directory.
